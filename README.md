## About

Venko is a protocol for issuing tokenized payments streams. It is designed for a variety
of common payments usecases, including:

- **Token lockups.** Issue team tokens.
- **Grants.** Issue revocable grants with a cliff and release schedule.
- **Escrow.** Send tokens to someone with a cancellation period, allowing you to cancel the payment if it was sent to the wrong address.
